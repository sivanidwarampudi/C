/*You can take a string as input in C using scanf(“%s”, s). But, it accepts string only until it finds the first space.
In order to take a line as input, you can use scanf("%[^\n]%*c", s); where  is defined as char s[MAX_LEN] where  is the maximum size of . Here, [] is the scanset character. ^\n stands for taking input until a newline isn't encountered. Then, with this %*c, it reads the newline character and here, the used * indicates that this newline character is discarded.
Note: The statement: scanf("%[^\n]%*c", s); will not work because the last statement will read a newline character, \n, from the previous line. This can be handled in a variety of ways. One way is to use scanf("\n"); before the last statement.
